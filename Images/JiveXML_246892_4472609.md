Atlantis event display of cosmic ray event 4472609 from run 246892. A cosmic ray is shown passing through the IBL, the newly installed pixel layer of the ATLAS detector, in the presence of a solenoidal magnetic field. The IBL is the inner-most layer in the display. The three layers surrounding the IBL are the other layers of the Pixel detector, and the four outer-most layers seen are the Semiconductor Tracker (SCT). These data were recorded during milestone run 7 (M7) which is being used to re-commision the ATLAS detector for Run2 startup.
